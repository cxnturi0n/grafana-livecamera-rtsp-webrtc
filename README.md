Imagine having IP cameras that stream video feeds over RTSP or video captured from your laptop's webcam, and you wish to visualize this content in real-time with extremely low latency, within your web browser or on a grafana dashboard because maybe you want to build an home monitoring dashboard.
You can achieve this by configuring go2rtc, a server that provides the shortest streaming latency possible and is effortless to set up on any operating system. You can checkout this fantastic project on its official GitHub repository: https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc.

In this simple repo I show you how to easily configure go2rtc to listen for an rtsp stream and allow you to visualize on a grafana dashboard.
